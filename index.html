        <h1 id="top">COPA CODERS</h1>
        <p>This is the official website for the <strong>COPA CODERS</strong>, a <a href="coderdojo.html">CoderDojo</a> with affiliated <a href="codeclub.html">Code Clubs</a> located in Maricopa, AZ. Please <a href="https://m.me/copacoders" target="_blank">message us</a> or visit <a href="https://fb.me/copacoders" target="_blank">our Facebook page</a> if you are interested in volunteering or registering your child.</p>
        <h2 id="members">Dojo Members</h2>
        <p>We are a community-driven, all volunteer youth technology education club. We need many individuals working together to help youth in Maricopa creatively solve problems using technology that will drive them for years to come.</p>
        <h3 id="ninjas">Ninjas</h3>
        <p>CoderDojos around the world are designed for kids ages 7 to 17 as they explore technology through coding, developing anything from websites to robots that learn the environment around them. We call our dojo participants Ninjas and they are the focus of everything we do in COPA CODERS. Ninjas come on a weekly basis to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>meet with like-minded people and discuss interests</li>
            <li>seek help with self-paced learning to accomplish goals</li>
            <li>develop goals and work toward them in a positive environment</li>
            <li>share accomplishments together with other Ninjas</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="callout"><strong>PLEASE NOTE:</strong> Ninjas under the age of 13 will need to be accompanied by a parent or guardian-approved adult for the duration of all Dojo events.</p>
        <h3 id="mentors">Mentors</h3>
        <p>A mentor is an individual (with or without technical skills) who guides Dojo attendees and facilitates their learning and project work during the sessions. Mentors can have a preferred area of expertise they like to work in (eg. HTML, Python, graphic design, video, etc.), and this can influence the topics covered in the Dojo. It is also common for non-technical mentors to learn the basics of Scratch to be able to work with beginners.</p>
        <p class="callout">We are always on the lookout for mentors. Please <a href="https://m.me/copacoders">contact us</a> and tell us how you'd like to get involved. Remember, <strong>you don't have to be a technology expert</strong> to be a great mentor!</p>
        <h3 id="volunteers">Volunteers</h3>
        <p>A volunteer is an individual who helps with Dojo administration and related tasks. For example, parents of regular attendees and individuals who prefer not to work directly with children in the Dojo can help by organizing and managing events and registration, updating social media, producing flyers, and more.</p>
        <h3 id="codeclubs">Code Clubs</h3>
        <p>Code Clubs are extracurricular clubs running at elementary and middle schools to help teach basics programming skills. We partner with local Code Clubs to help provide resources and transition students to join the dojo and become coding ninjas! More information can be found <a href="codeclub.html">here</a>.</p>
        <h2 id="showcase">Ninja Showcase</h2>
