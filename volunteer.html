        <h1>COPA CODERS &mdash; Volunteer</h1>
        <p class="callout">We are looking for volunteers in running our weekly CoderDojo at the City of Maricopa Public Library. As an organization that is youth-centered, we require our volunteers to be registered with the library as volunteers and pass a background check. If you are not already a registered volunteer, please visit the Library's <a href='https://www.volgistics.com/ex/portal.dll/ap?ap=1691487956' target="_blank">Volunteer Application Form</a> to initiate the application process. Once you are approved, come back here and register with the same email you registered as a volunteer for the City. We will also provide periodic, <emphasis>mandatory</emphasis> training to ensure we can all do our best to keep our youth safe.</p>
        <h2>Volunteer Opportunities</h2>
        <p>Thank you for your interest in volunteering with <strong>COPA CODERS</strong>. If you haven't already, please read about <a href="">what a CoderDojo is</a> and how we work with <a href="">Code Clubs</a> in our local schools. We are so excited to bring these programs to our youth in Maricopa and your interest in helping us fulfill this vision!</p>
        <p>There are several roles we are looking for help in both in our CoderDojo as well as our individual Code Clubs. While many volunteers are already technologically-savvy, just as many are new to coding and making projects now possible with low-power, low-cost devices like the Raspberry Pi. Whether an interested beginner or a seasoned IT professional (and everything in-between), we welcome you to learn with and help our children turn a passion for technology into a passion for life-long learning and open up opportunities for the rest of their lives.</p>
