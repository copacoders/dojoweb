        <h1>COPA CODERS &mdash; Code Club</h1>
        <p class="callout">COPA CODERS isn't a Raspberry Pi Foundation "Code Club" which runs at a school with direct teacher oversight. However, we are a <a href="coderdojo.html">CoderDojo</a> which operates in cooperation with Code Clubs in the same mission of helping young people learn how to program and build their own solutions using modern technology. Our goal is to help local schools become familiar with the Code Club program and support teachers and their students in these efforts.</p>
        <h2>What are Code Clubs?</h2>
        <p>In short, a Code Club is an extracurricular club for students ages 9-13. Clubs are organized by teachers and volunteers. Students learn programming as they follow guides created by the Raspberry Pi Foundation on a project-based curriculum. Once complete, Code Club members move on to their own projects and can even become mentors in their school's Code Club or CoderDojo.</p>
        <h3>Objectives</h3>
        <p>Students learn how to create games, animations and webpages using:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Scratch</li>
            <li>Python</li>
            <li>HTML/CSS</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These building blocks provide the basis for working with different programming languages as they pursue more self-directed and self-paced project work.</p>
        <h3>Code Clubs and CoderDojo</h3>
        <p>Code Clubs help those new to the idea of programming while CoderDojos help those explore their own interests further. Once a student completes the Code Club projects, they are encouraged to join a local CoderDojo to take their newfound skills to the next level, such as COPA CODERS.</p>
        <p>COPA CODERS has professional technology mentors that demonstrate and guide our <a href="index.html#ninjas">ninjas</a> in their technology education. Armed with these new skills, they can take their Scratch, Python and HTML skills they learned in Code Club and build complex, professional software, run dynamic websites, develop AI learning, pursue experiments in robotics, home automation and many, many more ideas!</p>
        <p>Please <a href="https://m.me/copacoders" target="_blank">contact us</a> if you are interested in starting a Coder Club at your student's school or, if you already have the support of a teacher you can <a href="https://codeclub.org/get-involved">get involved</a> right now.</p>
